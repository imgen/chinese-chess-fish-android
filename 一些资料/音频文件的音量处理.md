R128GAIN

rsgain (really simple gain) is a ReplayGain 2.0 command line utility for Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, and Android. rsgain applies loudness metadata tags to your files, while leaving the audio stream untouched. A ReplayGain-compatible player will dynamically adjust the volume of your tagged files during playback.

rsgain is designed with a "batteries included" philosophy, allowing a user to scan their entire music library without requiring external scripts or other tools. It aims to strike the perfect balance between power and simplicity by providing multiple user interfaces. See Usage for more information.
